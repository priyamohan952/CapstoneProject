Python is used for data transformation by using different functions in Pandas. Python Pandas is used to create a dataframe. Required columns for analysis are used to create a dataframe. Various models are created. The models created are Simple Moving Average model, Linear Regression, k-Nearest Neighbors, Auto ARIMA, Prophet and LSTM. The best model is chosen on the basis of RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error). A low RMSE is better. Linear Regerssion is evaluated as the best model on the basis of RMSE>
Python is used for data visualization. It is used to represent data in the various models.
